#🏞️ Trials of the Valley 
Goal:
 Add timed challenges (Trials) to Stardew Valley that reward players with randomized loot or temporary effects — while encouraging different playstyles and making co-op more dynamic.

🧪 How It Works
🎯 1. Trial Offers
Players receive Trials by mail at the start of each season and  year.


Each trial challenges the player to do something specific (e.g., grow crops, mine 100 ore, gift an NPC, catch 20 fish).


Trials are forced — players only have to read the letter to trigger it.



⏳ 2. Trial Duration
Every trial has a time limit (either 30 days or 1 year).


If the player completes the task in time, they can claim a reward.


If the player fails or ignores the trial, they get a punishment/debuff instead.



🎁 3. Rewards (No Points System)
Upon completing a trial, players click “Claim random Reward”.
A  random reward, being either an Item, a structure, a temporary effect or money is given to the player.

Additionally, if the player has a malus, all the current debuffs/restrictions will be removed.


😵 4. Punishments
Failing a trial gives a debuff or restriction, like:


Can't use certain tools


Can't eat food


Reduced movement speed


Punishments can stack up infinitely. They can only be removed by completing a quest.




🤝 5. Co-op Enhancements
Trials and maluses are all unique Per player when playing Co-op.
